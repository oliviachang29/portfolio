<p>Scholarbird helps you discover scholarships through a UI that's actually nice to use. Users can filter scholarships by criteria (GPA, gender, etc.) and save them for later. It runs on Node.js and React, and uses Okta for authentication. The scholarships are pulled from a Google Sheet using Sheety.co API.</p>

<p>It was very important to me that Scholarbird was user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing, and I focused a lot on polishing the design - making it professional and intuitive.</p>
