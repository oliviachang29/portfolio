<p>My family is Potter-obsessed. We regularly quiz each other on super obscure Harry Potter facts. We turned this into an Alexa skill so other people could enjoy it.</p>

<p class="p-small-margin-bottom">An Amazon review:</p>

<p class="full-width-text quote p-small-margin-top">"I listen to the Harry Potter books almost every sing night before I go to bed. I re-read them every year, and I have an annual club meeting with people who legit test on this stuff. This is hard. VERY hard. If you are a FANATIC like me, this is what you are looking for. If you read the books occasionally, this book isn't for you. It asks for page numbers, obscure names, potion ingredients, spells only used once. It is very hard, and loads of fun. LOADS. I spent hours doing this alone."</p>
